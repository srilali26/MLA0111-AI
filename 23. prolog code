% Base case: sum of integers from 1 to 1 is 1
sum_up_to_n(1, 1).

% Recursive case: sum of integers from 1 to n is Sum, where Sum is the sum of integers from 1 to n-1 plus n
sum_up_to_n(N, Sum) :-
    N > 1,                      % Ensure N is greater than 1
    N1 is N - 1,                % Decrement N by 1
    sum_up_to_n(N1, Sum1),     % Recursively compute the sum of integers from 1 to n-1
    Sum is Sum1 + N.            % Calculate the sum of integers from 1 to n
